#Lip

Lip gets both internal ipv4 and external ip on demand, also it checks open ports on external ip. It has a shortkey to bring it up if minimized which is ctrl+m.

This application was created for when setting up servers and such so you don't have to keep opening a browser to check external ip and also use multiple sites for port checking.
